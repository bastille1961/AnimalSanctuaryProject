# AnimalSantuaryProject

## Overview

This is a basic program to practice building and evaluating how 
Inheritance and Polymorphism function in programming. 



## Description

This is a basic application that allow the user to select an animal(s)
from a numbered menu, personalize the selected animal type by giving it
a name, and then assign it to an enclosure. If the enclosure if full,
the user will be informed as much.

## How to Use this Application

- Respond to query "Select animal 1: with a number 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- Respond to "Enter name for the animal:" by typing a name. (e.g., "Roxy").
- Respond to "Enter enclosure number (1-5) for the animal:" Type number.
- The enclosure will advise if an enclosure is already occupied.
- Once all enclosures are filled, an attendant may be selected/named.
- The user is then prompted to allow the Attendant start the feeding rounds.
- Each animal is fed based on a randomly generated number.
- The animal then declares its specific sound and type of food it enjoys consuming.
- The user will then be prompted to enter a 'Q' or 'q' to quit the application.


## Technologies Used

* MacOS Terminal/Unix
* Sublime Simple Text Editor
* Object-Oriented Programming Methods using:
	* Inheritance
	* Polymorphism
	* Override
	* Arrays
* Java utilities for Scanner Object, and InputMismatchException to preclude program
  failure when a User enters an incorrect selection.

## Lessons Learned and Review Topics

* Eclipse is version sensitive to certain syntax.
* Keep application goals and schematic/UML diagram in line of sight while coding.


## To-Dos

* Learn more effective ways to use @Override and resolve Eclipse vers. errors.
